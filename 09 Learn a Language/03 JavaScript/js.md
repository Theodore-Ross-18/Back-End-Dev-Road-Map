# ***JavaScript***

> Apart from being used in the browser, JavaScript is also used in backend e.g. using Node.js or Deno for writing server-side code in JavaScript.

> If you pick up JavaScript for the Backend, my personal recommendation would be to learn JavaScript and then go with Node.js as it is the most popular and widely used option.

> Also, I would recommend learning TypeScript later on as you continue with your backend development Journey; itâ€™s a superset of JavaScript and is used in many projects.
