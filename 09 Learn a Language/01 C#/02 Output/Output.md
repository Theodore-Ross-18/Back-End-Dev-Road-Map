# C# Output

> To output values or print text in C#, you can use the WriteLine() method:

```
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

> Note: You can add as many WriteLine() methods as you want. Note that it will add a new line for each method. 

> You can also output numbers, and perform mathematical calculations:

```
Console.WriteLine(3 + 3);
```

## The Write Method

> There is also a Write() method, which is similar to WriteLine().

> The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

```
Console.Write("Hello World! ");
Console.Write("I will print on the same line.");
```
