# C# Files

> Working With Files

> The `File` class from the `System.IO` namespace, allows us to work with files:

Example
```
using System.IO;  // include the System.IO namespace

File.SomeFileMethod();  // use the file class with methods
```

The `File` class has many useful methods for creating and getting information about files. For example:

| Method | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| `AppendText()`  | Appends text at the end of an existing file |
| `Copy()` | Copies a file |
| `Create()` | Creates or overwrites a file | 
Delete() | Deletes a file |
| `Exists()` | Tests whether the file exists |
|`ReadAllText()` | Reads the contents of a file |
| `Replace()` | Replaces the contents of a file with the contents of another file |
| `WriteAllText()` | Creates a new file and writes the contents to it. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. |

## Write To a File and Read It

> In the following example, we use the `WriteAllText()` method to create a file named "filename.txt" and write some content to it. Then we use the `ReadAllText()` method to read the contents of the file:

Example
```
using System.IO;  // include the System.IO namespace

string writeText = "Hello World!";  // Create a text string
File.WriteAllText("filename.txt", writeText);  // Create a file and write the content of writeText to it

string readText = File.ReadAllText("filename.txt");  // Read the contents of the file
Console.WriteLine(readText);  // Output the content
```

The output will be:
```
Hello  World!
```
